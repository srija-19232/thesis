1.first i have installed the git by the command:
  
    sudo apt-get install git

2.then next i have updated the git 
    
    sudo apt-get update

    
commit all three files and your markdown document detailing your work, including the edit to clean.py as detailed in the manuscript

finally, get the output from git log and git diff 

and add them to the final edit of your Markdown file, to show what has happened during that git session

set up and synchronize a github account

push the contents of this folder to your github account

     3. cd Downloads
        tar xvf codes.tar
        
and the answer we get for this is:

code/
code/README.md
code/analyze.R
code/clean.py
code/process.sh

      4. mkdir -p ../thesis
         cp code/* ../thesis
         cd ../thesis
          ls

the answer to this is:

thesis$ ls
analyze.R  clean.py  process.sh  README.md

      5. git init
      
the answer for this is:

Initialized empty Git repository in /home/adb01/thesis/.git/

       6. git config user.name "srija-19232"
       git status
       
answer is:

On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	README.md
	analyze.R
	clean.py
	process.sh

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

       7.git add process.sh
       git add clean.py analyze.R
       git commit -m "Add initial version of thesis code."

answer is:

[master (root-commit) 5bcd497] Add initial version of thesis code.
 3 files changed, 154 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 analyze.R
 create mode 100644 clean.py
 create mode 100644 process.sh

         8. git log
         nano -w clean.py
         tail clean.py
         
here we edited the file from 10 to 20 and saved the changes:

# Filter based on fold-change over control sample
fc_cutoff = 20
epithelial = epithelial.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()
proximal_tube = proximal_tube.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()
kidney = kidney.filter(filter_fold_change, fc = fc_cutoff).saveas()
# Identify only those sites that are peaks in all three tissue types
combined = pybedtools.BedTool().multi_intersect(
           i = [epithelial.fn, proximal_tube.fn, kidney.fn])
union = combined.filter(lambda x: int(x[3]) == 3).saveas()
union.cut(range(3)).saveas(data + "/sites-union.bed")

         9. git diff 
         
the answer is:

diff --git a/clean.py b/clean.py
index 9f76681..7f7ccf1 100644

           10. git remote add origin https://github.com/srija-19232/thesis
           git pull origin master

this is the answer:
